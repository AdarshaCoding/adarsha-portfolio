# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**_Firebase Setup_**

- website: https://firebase.google.com/
- npm install firebase
- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login (Sign in to Google)
- firebase init (Initiate your project)
- firebase deploy (When you're ready, deploy your web app)

To deploy the changes from your local code base to the already deployed Firebase project, you just need to follow these simple steps:
• Make your changes locally.
• Rebuild your Vite app with npm run build.
• Deploy the build to Firebase Hosting using firebase deploy.
• Check the changes at your Firebase Hosting URL.
